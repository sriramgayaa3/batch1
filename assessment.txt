Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.
A data type defines the type of data that can be stored and manipulated in a programming language. It specifies:

The type of value (e.g., integer, string, boolean).
The operations that can be performed on the data.
The memory required to store the value.
Data types are essential because they help the compiler or interpreter understand how the programmer intends to use the data.

Types of Data Types
Data types are generally categorized into two main types:

Primitive Data Types
Non-Primitive Data Types
1. Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the most basic types of data that are predefined by the programming language. They represent single values and are directly operated upon by machine instructions.

Common Primitive Data Types:
Integer (int): Represents whole numbers.
Example: 10, -25, 0
Floating-point (float or double): Represents numbers with decimal points.
Example: 3.14, -0.99
Character (char): Represents a single character.
Example: 'A', 'z', '9'
Boolean (bool): Represents true or false values.
Example: true, false
String (string): (In some languages, this is considered primitive) Represents sequences of characters.
Example: "Hello", "123"
Characteristics of Primitive Data Types:
Simple and atomic.
Fixed size in memory (depending on the language and architecture).
2. Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types are more complex and derived from primitive data types. They can store multiple values or more complex structures.

Common Non-Primitive Data Types:
Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type.

Example: [1, 2, 3, 4], ['A', 'B', 'C']
Strings: (In some languages, considered non-primitive) A sequence of characters.

Example: "OpenAI", "Data Types"
Classes/Objects: Represent real-world entities with attributes and methods.

Example: A Car class with attributes like color and speed.
Lists (or ArrayLists): A dynamic collection of elements (e.g., Python list).

Example: [10, "apple", 3.14]
Tuples: An immutable collection of elements.

Example: (1, "John", 3.5)
Sets: A collection of unique elements.

Example: {1, 2, 3}
Dictionaries (or HashMaps): A collection of key-value pairs.

Example: {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
Characteristics of Non-Primitive Data Types:
Can store multiple values or more complex structures.
More flexible and powerful.
Often require more memory.
